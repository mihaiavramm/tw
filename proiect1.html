            <h3><strong> THUNDER ROAD</strong></h3>
            <p>Thunder Road begins with a ten-minute single-take scene of such cringe-worthy humor and wrenching pathos
                that it&#39;s a borderline miracle the film manages to live up to it. That it certainly does, as
                writer-director-star Jim Cummings&#39;s first feature deftly navigates the uneasy tragicomic territory
                inhabited by its main character, Texas police officer Jim Arnaud. Reeling from the death of his mother
                (whose funeral is the setting for the aforementioned opener), and coping with an impending divorce from
                his ex (Jocelyn DeBoer) and the cold-shoulder treatment from his fourth-grader daughter (Kendal Farr),
                Jim begins to lose it at home and at work, this despite the best efforts of his kindhearted partner
                (Nican Robinson). Cummings&#39;s expertly calibrated turn moves between heartbreaking and absurd at a
                moment&#39;s notice, providing an unvarnished snapshot of one angry, unstable but good-natured man&#39;s
                grief-stricken disintegration. It&#39;s a film that knows what it&#39;s like to feel as if your world is
                falling apart, and the difficulty of making it-and yourself, and your family-whole again.</p>
            <p><strong>Starring:</strong> Jim Cummings, Kendal Farr, Nican Robinson</p>

            <h3><strong> FIRST REFORMED</strong></h3>
            <p>It&#39;s been forty-two years since Taxi Driver first verified Paul Schrader&#39;s greatness, and with First
                Reformed, the writer-director provides a magnificent companion piece to that earlier triumph. Also
                indebted to Robert Bresson, Andrei Tarkovsky, and Ingmar Bergman, Schrader&#39;s religious drama (shot in a
                boxy 1.37:1 aspect ratio) fixates on Reverend Toller (Ethan Hawke), an upstate New York man of the
                cloth whose ongoing crisis-of-faith is accelerated by an encounter with an environmental activist beset
                by hopelessness and anger. Toller&#39;s ensuing relationship with that man&#39;s wife (Amanda Seyfried), as
                well as the leader of a local mega-church (Cedric the Entertainer), forms the basis of Schrader&#39;s
                rigorously ascetic-and occasionally expressionistic-film, which is guided by Toller&#39;s journal-entry
                narration about his fears and doubts. Formally exquisite and led by a tremendous performance from Hawke
                as a Travis Bickle-like country priest who can&#39;t quell the darkness within, it&#39;s a spiritual inquiry
                made harrowing by both its mounting misery and its climactic ambiguity.</p>

            <h3><strong> YOU WERE NEVER REALLY HERE</strong></h3>
            <p>Joaquin Phoenix reconfirms his status as his generation&#39;s finest leading man with You Were Never Really
                Here, a startling drama that cares less for straightforward thrills than for penetrating psychological
                intensity. Barreling forward with urgent momentum and fragmented lyricism (thanks to oblique edits and
                jarring flashbacks), the latest from Scottish auteur Lynne Ramsay (Ratcatcher, We Need to Talk About
                Kevin)
                tracks a mentally scarred war vet (Phoenix) as he tries to rescue a senator&#39;s young daughter from a
                child
                prostitution ring. There&#39;s plenty of bloodshed throughout that underworld quest, yet Ramsay&#39;s treatment
                of
                violence is anything but exploitative; rather, her film resounds as a lament for the trauma of
                childhood
                abuse, which lingers on after adolescence has given way to adulthood. Reminiscent of Taxi Driver, and
                energized by Phoenix&#39;s magnetic embodiment of masculine suffering and sorrow, it&#39;s a gut-wrenching
                portrait
                of a volatile man&#39;s attempts to achieve some measure of solace from his inner demons-sometimes via the
                use
                of a ball-peen hammer.</p>
            <p><strong>Starring:</strong> Joaquin Phoenix, Judith Roberts, Ekaterina Samsonov </p>
            <p><strong>Directed By:</strong> Lynne Ramsay</p>

            <h3><strong> COLD WAR</strong></h3>
            <p>An ethnomusicologist and an aspiring young singer are gripped by l&#39;amour fou in Pawel Pawlikowski&#39;s Cold
                War, whose rapturous black-and-white cinematography and lyrically oblique style are reminiscent of the
                director&#39;s prior, Academy Award-winning Ida. Repeatedly thrust together and torn apart by their ardent
                passion, Wiktor (Tomasz Kot) and Zula (Joanna Kulig) meet in Poland in the late 1940s when he hires her
                to be a member of his folk music troupe. Over the ensuing decade, the pair realize that they can&#39;t
                stand to be apart, even if being together is also unsustainable-a push-pull dynamic in which the
                personal is, given their communism-defined circumstances, also deeply political. Wiktor&#39;s subsequent
                flight to Paris to be a jazz musician does nothing to dull their love for each other, and Pawlikowski
                dramatizes their unique bond through painterly imagery and an editorial structure that suggests much
                through unexpected cuts. Theirs is an affair of complex volatility, with Kot and Kulig exhibiting an
                old-school charisma that enhances the proceedings&#39; swoon-worthy allure..</p>
            <p><strong>Starring:</strong> Joanna Kulig, Tomasz Kot, Borys Szyc </p>
            <p><strong>Directed By:</strong> Pawel Pawlikowski</p>
