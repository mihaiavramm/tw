                <h3><strong> MANDY</strong></h3>
                <p>The psychosexual hallucinatory heavy-metal grindhouse revenge saga of your cinematic dreams, Mandy
                    is a midnight movie of mythic madness. Director Panos Cosmatos’s wickedly deviant and humorous
                    follow-up to 2011’s Beyond the Black Rainbow concerns a woodsman named Red (Nicolas Cage) whose
                    wife, Mandy (Andrea Riseborough), is taken hostage at their secluded forest home by cultists led by
                    crazed guru Jeremiah Sand (Linus Roache). After that situation ends in cataclysm, Red embarks on a
                    rampage as trippy as it is brutal, as Cosmatos creates a pulpy atmosphere of pulsating LSD-fueled
                    doom and gloom that envelops his protagonist as he descends into ever-more-depraved territory.
                    Torture, mayhem, and shadowy supernatural fiends factor into this orgiastic pulp, which
                    features—among its many euphorically insane sights—its hero lighting a cigarette from a flaming
                    decapitated head, a boozy bathroom freak-out and the greatest big-screen chainsaw fight since
                    1986’s The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2. Hovering over the action like a wide-eyed goth specter,
                    Riseborough proves an enchanting object of black-magic desire. </p>
                <p><strong>Starring:</strong> Nicolas Cage, Andrea Riseborough, Linus Roache</p>
                <p><strong>Directed By:</strong> Panos Cosmatos</p>

            <h3><strong>ANNIHILATION</strong></h3>
            <p>Annihilation is the best sci-fi film in years, a mind-blowing trip into an inscrutable heart of darkness
                that marks writer-director Alex Garland as one of the genre’s true greats. Desperate to understand what
                happened to her soldier husband (Oscar Issac) on his last mission, a biologist (Natalie Portman)
                ventures alongside four comrades (Jennifer Jason Leigh, Tessa Thompson, Gina Rodriguez, Tuva Novotny)
                into a mysterious, and rapidly growing, hot zone known as the “Shimmer.” What follows is an unsettling
                and hallucinatory tale of destruction and transformation, division and replication—dynamics that
                Garland posits as the fundamental building blocks of every aspect of existence, and which fully come to
                the fore during a climax of such surreal birth-death insanity that it has to be seen to be believed.
                Apropos for a story about nature’s endless cycles of synthesis and mutation, it combines elements of
                numerous predecessors (Apocalypse Now, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Stalker, The Thing) to create something
                wholly and frighteningly unique. </p>
