                <h3><strong> MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - FALLOUT</strong></h3>
                <p>Tom Cruise risks life and limb - literally, in many instances - for his sixth go - round as Ethan
                    Hunt in Mission: Impossible - Fallout, the finest action film since 2015&#39;s Mad Max: Fury
                    Road. In writer-director Christopher McQuarrie&#39;s adrenalized espionage thriller, Hunt is
                    tasked with recovering a trio of plutonium cores while juggling his relationships with
                    colleagues (Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Alec Baldwin), alluring spy Ilsa Faust (Rebecca
                    Ferguson), and former wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan) - not to mention CIA-assigned assassin
                    August Walker (Henry Cavill), who has orders to kill Hunt should he stray from his
                    assignment. That intertwining of the personal and professional provides a sturdy backbone
                    for a series of set pieces that, especially in IMAX, are nothing short of astonishing.
                    McQuarrie begins with a slam-bang bathroom brawl and then continually ups the eye-opening
                    ante, culminating with an aerial showdown between Hunt and Walker aboard helicopters that
                    establishes Cruise, and the series, as the reigning kings of Hollywood spectacle.</p>
                <p><strong>Starring:</strong> Tom Cruise, Henry Cavill, Ving Rhames</p>
                <p><strong>Directed By:</strong> Christopher McQuarrie</p>

                <h3><strong> THE MULE</strong></h3>
                <p>In his first performance in six years, Clint Eastwood brings an elegiac gracefulness and good humor
                    -
                    not to
                    mention defiant toughness - to the role of a 90-year-old flower aficionado named Earl who opts to
                    work
                    as a
                    drug runner in The Mule. Eastwood&#39;s lined visage and creaky comportment can&#39;t dull his
                    fiery
                    spirit in this
                    based-on-real-events drama, which finds the Hollywood icon amusingly raging against modernity&#39;s
                    Internet-and-smartphone addictions, even as his down-on-his-luck character grapples with the
                    familial
                    cost
                    of putting personal obsessions above all else. Pursued by Bradley Cooper&#39;s ambitious DEA agent,
                    who&#39;s
                    similarly striving to meet the requirements of a demanding boss (Laurence Fishburne),
                    Eastwood&#39;s
                    protagonist proves another one of his broken-down big-screen warriors. Full of ladies&#39; man
                    charm
                    and
                    self-deprecating wit, his turn is as assured as his typically efficient direction, which balances
                    suspense
                    and poignancy with aplomb. It&#39;s further confirmation that the legendary filmmaker hasn&#39;t
                    lost
                    his nimble,
                    self-referential touch.</p>
                <p><strong>Starring:</strong> Clint Eastwood, Bradley Cooper, Taissa Farmiga </p>
                <p><strong>Directed By:</strong> Clint Eastwood</p>

                <h3><strong> FILMWORKER</strong></h3>
                <p>Leon Vitali delivered a star-making turn as Lord Bullingdon in Stanley Kubrick&#39; s 1975
                    period-piece
                    Barry
                    Lyndon. After that performance, however, the actor opted to become his director&#39; s right-hand
                    man -
                    a position
                    he would hold until Kubrick&#39; s death in 1999. Filmworker, Tony Zierra&#39; s outstanding
                    documentary about
                    Vitali, is a portrait of a man who subsumed his own priorities and personality in order to be
                    whatever
                    his
                    employer required, which in this case included operating as an acting coach, a script supervisor,
                    an
                    exacting technician, and an advertising manager. A study of obsessive devotion and
                    self-destruction,
                    Zierra&#39; s film conveys the round-the-clock arduousness of assisting a perfectionist like
                    Kubrick,
                    and the
                    toll such employment took on Vitali&#39; s health and relationship with his family. Now an
                    apprentice
                    without a
                    master, Vitali proves a complex figure of commitment taken to a crazy extreme - as well as an
                    intriguing
                    artist in his own right, whose recognition for the work he did alongside the 2001: A Space Odyssey
                    and
                    The
                    Shining auteur remains long overdue.</p>

                <p><strong>Directed By:</strong> Tony Zierra</p>
